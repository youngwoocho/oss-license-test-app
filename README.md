# Open Source License Test App

Purpose: To test the following libraries that can automatically show open source licenses

- [AboutLibraries](https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries)
- [OSS Licenses Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/google/play-services-plugins/tree/master/oss-licenses-plugin)

---

The criteria for a good library are:

- Easy to setup and use
- Can add custom license text for libraries that do not have properly configured Maven POM
